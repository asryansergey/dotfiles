# Dotfiles

A small set of my custom dotfiles to personalize your system. The script would create backup of
existing .file(s) in your home directory and create symbolic links to the ones in the current directory.

#### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/asryansergey/dotfiles.git
cd ./dotfiles
./apply_configs.sh
```
> Other files *(like iterm, zsh_theme etc)* require manual actions.
